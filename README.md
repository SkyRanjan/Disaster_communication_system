# Telegraph
This is a project developed with the intent to provide an efficient and reliable system for communication during any situation of distress or calamity
In this project an initiative has been taken to restore the traditional telegraph with a modern touch to its usecase. Previously, telegraph was used majorly for espoinage purposes and required a defined setuo and a timer which was required for the decryption of the message. In this porject as we are addressing the need of full filling a communication system to be used in the area of distress so this system maybe deployed in the areas where the desired traditional setup may not be available. So, in this setup we have used 4 LEDs two of red colour and two of blue colour. Both the colours depict the dots(.) and dashes(_) respectively, as the message is entered in the webpage, the message is encrypted into the morsecode consisting of dots and dashes in a particular pattern. Then this morsecode is sent to the webserver built with nodejs, the webserver then sends the commands to the GPIO pins, when there is a dot encountered in the message the red LED are turned on and when a dash is encountered the blue LED is trurned on. This way the message is transferred. The colour of the light is selected so that the ones with the highest wavelength is selected so that it can be used in every field
required. TCP communication using HTTP protocol has been used in order to facilitate the services desired.
